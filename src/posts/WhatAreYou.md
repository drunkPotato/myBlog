### A Plan to Understand Things <br>

To make sound decisions aligned with your true goals, you must understand both yourself and the environment you act within. <br>
This post is a strategic attempt to explore what matters most.<br>

### The Approach Will Be

#### 1. Prioritize Topics
- Key aspects of reality that give us practical leverage, by enabling or by avoiding traps
- Rate topics based on relevance, magnitude, potential, urgency, etc.

#### 2. Clarify the Current Understanding
- Establish foundational concepts (What needs to be addressed?)
- Survey common intuition or misconceptions 
- Develop a working model

#### 3. Empirical Testing
- Use real cases or counterexamples  
- Identify limits, contradictions, or oversights in the current model

#### 4. Identify Key Insights
- Extract recurring patterns and mechanisms  
- Create mental models

#### 5. Actionable Steps
- Improve Decision Accuracy
- Increase Execution Reliability


### Biology
#### Why cover Biology?<br>
Because human biology can explain a great deal about human behaviour. Understanding our biological nature is key because:
*   It helps us understand **ourselves** ‚Äì why we feel and act in certain ways.
*   It helps us understand **other people**, whose actions significantly influence us.

Recognizing these biological influences is often the first step toward gaining more awareness and potentially, more deliberate control over our responses.
#### Base Knowledge

##### Evolution<br>
Understanding human evolution helps us because:
  - Behaviour has evoluitonary roots
  - Our environment has changed rapidly
  - Adapting to our environment gives us leverage


Your biology is not random.<br>
It is the product of millions of years of natural selection, optimizing for survival and reproduction in ancient environments.<br>
Humans evolved in small tribes with scarce food, no technology and immediate physical threats.<br>

At least for now because Artificial Intelligence is not there yet.<br>
However a single celled organism doesnt experience the world.<br>
Consciousness is poorly understood to this very day.<br>
However we can be fairly sure that consciousness is a spectrum.<br>
It will be hard for you to deny experience. Humans can feel a variety of things.<br>
Examples are: Temperature, Love, Sounds, etc...<br>
The question is: "Do animals experience too and if yes, how?"<br>
It is, however, not possible to ask your dog how he is feeling.<br>
Nevertheless, a dog shows behaviour linked to experience. They exhibit "happy" behaviour when you return 
and "sad" ones when you leave.<br>
Humans and dogs are still very complex organisms.<br>
How does a fly experience the world?<br>
What about a pigeon?<br>

You are a brain centred biological organism.<br>


You need air, water, food, sleep, etc. to keep complex biological systems and processes running.<br>
When the body cannot sustain itself, "you" die.<br><br>
Your mind is not seperate from your body.<br>
Take a moment to think how differently you think when:<br>
<br>
Tired
<br>
Angry
<br>
Having Sex
<br>
<br>
Our biology isn't random.<br>
It's the product of millions of years of evolution favouring survival and reproduction.<br>
Many irrational behaviours can be traced back to this.<br>
Later we will explore what this means for you and how to adapt.<br>

### Level 2: Your Experiences
On an abstract level, you are a stream of conscious experience. You can feel happy, tired, cold or wet...
This is much of where YOU truly happen. 

Because of evolution, behaviour that increased fitness, like having sex and eating, is rewarding (feels good). 
It's also why behaviour that decreases fitness, like social isolation or getting injured, are punished (feel bad).

### Level 3: You as a Builder
Incredibly, you can observe, reflect and analyze your mental states. 
This enables us to change our behaviour in desired ways. 
If you notice that you are overweight and are unhappy about it, you can start doing sports to change that.



## The implications

So what? , I hear you ask.
Well, realising this enables us to recognise patterns in our world and ourselfes.


## How you can take control

This refers to the 3rd Level


#### Common pitfalls <br>
Consider a few common behaviours: <br><br>
  Losing hours to social media's scroll, feeling worse, not better. <br>
  Starting 'just one more' game / bet / episode long after enjoyment fades." <br>
  Craving sugar, nicotine, alcohol, where brief highs demand another. <br>
  Impulsive shopping resulting in regret. <br><br>
These and similar behaviours are not coincidence. <br>
They are the result of sophisticated systems. <br>
