## Introduction


It's easy to be caught in the current.
However, one should stop and think.

We get lost in the day-to-day, but stepping back to examine the core aspects of our own existence can be incredibly empowering.

( Note: Add Examples where this is beneficial)

One of the more important skills is to know what is important.
Let's begin.

## Levels of You

### Level 1: Your Biology

1. Biologic Survival
On a basic level, you are a brain centred biological organism.
You need air, water, food, sleep, etc. These aren't preferences; they are fundamental requirements. 
When the body ceases to function, for all practical purposes, "you" cease to exist in this form.

2. Body - Mind Problem
This physical body isn't just a passive container. 
It actively shapes your state of mind and moment-to-moment experience (e.g. Hormones, Neurotransmitters).
Think about how you are thinking differently when tired, angry, on drugs or when having sex.

3. Shaped by Evolution
Our biology isn't random.
It's the product of millions of years of evolution favouring survival and reproduction.
Many irrational behaviours can be traced back to this.


### Level 2: Your Experiences
On an abstract level, you are a stream of conscious experience. You can feel happy, tired, cold or wet...
This is much of where YOU truly happen. 

Because of evolution, behaviour that increased fitness, like having sex and eating, is rewarding (feels good). 
It's also why behaviour that decreases fitness, like social isolation or getting injured, are punished (feel bad).

### Level 3: You as a Builder
Incredibly, you can observe, reflect and analyze your mental states. 
This enables us to change our behaviour in desired ways. 
If you notice that you are overweight and are unhappy about it, you can start doing sports to change that.



## The implications

So what? , I hear you ask.
Well, realising this enables us to recognise patterns in our world and ourselfes.


## How you can take control

This refers to the 3rd Level
