## Introduction

Do you ever feel like you're running on autopilot? <br>
It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, just responding to whatever comes next. <br>
Let's explore why deliberate thought can make a big difference.<br><br>
#### Example 1: Common pitfalls <br>
Consider a few common behaviours: <br><br>
  Losing hours to social media's scroll, feeling worse, not better. <br>
  Starting 'just one more' game / bet / episode long after enjoyment fades." <br>
  Craving sugar, nicotine, alcohol, where brief highs demand another. <br>
  Impulsive shopping resulting in regret. <br><br>
These and similar behaviours are not coincidence. <br>
They are the result of sophisticated systems. <br>
#### Example 2: Random Buttons
<div class="interactive-game-two">
<p class="game-instruction">Try to press these buttons until they display "You Win!"</p>
  <div class="game-buttons-container">
    <button id="left-button">Left</button> 
    <button id="right-button">Right</button>
  </div>
  <p id="hint-message" aria-live="polite" style="min-height: 1.2em;"></p> 
  <p id="victory-message" aria-live="polite"></p> 
</div>
<script src="/js/buttons.js" defer></script>

#### Example 3: The Hydra

<div class="interactive-skull-game">
  <div id="problem-box-container" style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; align-items: center; min-height: 80px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 10px auto; width: 90%; max-width: 400px; background-color: #ffffff;">
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 15px;">
    <button id="skull-button" style="font-size: 2.5em; padding: 5px 10px; background-color: #6c757d; color: white; border: 2px solid #343a40; cursor: not-allowed; opacity: 0.4;" >üíÄ</button>
  </div>
  <p id="skull-game-message" aria-live="polite" style="text-align: center; min-height: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px;"></p>
</div>

### Level 1: Your Biology

1. Biologic Survival
On a basic level, you are a brain centred biological organism.
You need air, water, food, sleep, etc. These aren't preferences; they are fundamental requirements. 
When the body ceases to function, for all practical purposes, "you" cease to exist in this form.

2. Body - Mind Problem
This physical body isn't just a passive container. 
It actively shapes your state of mind and moment-to-moment experience (e.g. Hormones, Neurotransmitters).
Think about how you are thinking differently when tired, angry, on drugs or when having sex.

3. Shaped by Evolution
Our biology isn't random.
It's the product of millions of years of evolution favouring survival and reproduction.
Many irrational behaviours can be traced back to this.


### Level 2: Your Experiences
On an abstract level, you are a stream of conscious experience. You can feel happy, tired, cold or wet...
This is much of where YOU truly happen. 

Because of evolution, behaviour that increased fitness, like having sex and eating, is rewarding (feels good). 
It's also why behaviour that decreases fitness, like social isolation or getting injured, are punished (feel bad).

### Level 3: You as a Builder
Incredibly, you can observe, reflect and analyze your mental states. 
This enables us to change our behaviour in desired ways. 
If you notice that you are overweight and are unhappy about it, you can start doing sports to change that.



## The implications

So what? , I hear you ask.
Well, realising this enables us to recognise patterns in our world and ourselfes.


## How you can take control

This refers to the 3rd Level
